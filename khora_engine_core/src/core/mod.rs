//! `core` module â€“ immediate runtime nucleus.
//!
//! Contents:
//! * [`engine`]: main orchestrator (loop, event dispatch, render invocation)
//! * [`monitoring`]: stats / hooks (will evolve into full metrics backend)
//! * [`metrics`]: centralized metrics system with thread-safe backends
//! * [`timer`]: lightweight CPU timing primitives (`Stopwatch`)
//! * [`utils`]: generic helpers (subject to future refactor as scope grows)
//!
//! Note: Future adaptive SAA components (DCC, negotiation, etc.) are not
//! implemented yet; this module provides insertion points for metrics
//! collection & decisions (e.g. after `update`, before `render`).

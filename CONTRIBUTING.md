# Contributing to KhoraEngine

First off, thank you for considering contributing to KhoraEngine! It's an ambitious project, and every bit of help is appreciated.

KhoraEngine is currently in its early stages of development. We are primarily focused on building the core Symbiotic Adaptive Architecture (SAA) and its foundational components like the Dynamic Context Core (DCC), Intelligent Subsystem Agents (ISAs), Goal-Oriented Resource Negotiation (GORNA), and exploring Adaptive Game Data Flows (AGDF).

## How Can I Contribute?

Given the current stage, here are the best ways you can contribute:

*   **Join the Discussion:** Share your thoughts, ideas, and feedback on our [GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/eraflo/KhoraEngine/discussions) (if enabled) or by opening an issue for discussion.
*   **Report Bugs:** If you experiment with the engine and find bugs, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/eraflo/KhoraEngine/issues) using the "Bug Report" template, providing detailed steps to reproduce.
*   **Suggest Features:** Have ideas for features that would complement the SAA vision or enhance the engine's capabilities? Propose them as an [Issue](https://github.com/eraflo/KhoraEngine/issues) using the "Feature Request" template.
*   **Improve Documentation:** As the project grows, documentation will be key. If you see areas for improvement or clarification, let us know or (once guidelines are clearer) submit a PR.

## Code Contributions (Future)

Direct code contributions are welcome but might be complex until the core architecture stabilizes. When we are ready for broader code contributions, this section will be updated with:

*   Development setup instructions.
*   Coding standards (we use `rustfmt` and `clippy` extensively).
*   The Pull Request process and template.
*   Testing guidelines.

For now, if you have a specific code contribution in mind, please start a discussion on GitHub (Discussions or an Issue) to discuss it with the maintainer (@eraflo) first.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We look forward to building an innovative engine with the community!

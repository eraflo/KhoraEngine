//! Implements Khora's custom **Chunked Relational Page ECS (CRPECS)**.
//!
//! This module contains the complete implementation of the engine's Entity-Component-System,
//! which is the heart of the **[D]ata** layer in the CLAD architecture.
//!
//! The CRPECS is designed from the ground up to enable the **Adaptive Game Data Flows (AGDF)**
//! concept from the SAA philosophy. Its key architectural feature is the dissociation
//! of an entity's identity from the physical storage of its component data, which allows
//! for extremely fast structural changes (adding/removing components).
//!
//! The primary entry point for interacting with the ECS is the [`World`] struct.

//! Provides the public, backend-agnostic rendering contracts for the Khora Engine.
//!
//! This module defines the "common language" for all rendering operations. It contains
//! the abstract `traits` (like [`GraphicsDevice`]), data structures (like [`BufferDescriptor`]),
//! and error types that form the stable, public-facing API for rendering.
//!
//! Following the CLAD architecture, this module defines the 'what' of rendering,
//! while the 'how' is handled by a concrete backend implementation in the `khora-infra`
//! crate (e.g., a WGPU backend) which implements these traits. The `khora-lanes`
//! and `khora-agents` then use these traits to perform their work without needing to
//! know the specifics of the underlying graphics API.

## Project Vision: Towards a Symbiotic Game Engine

Khora was born from an observation: modern game engines, despite their power, are fundamentally rigid. They force developers to perform complex manual optimizations and adapt poorly to the growing diversity of hardware, from high-end PCs to mobile and VR platforms.

Our vision is to create an engine that behaves like a living organism: a **symbiotic** system where each component is aware of its environment and collaborates to achieve a common goal. Rather than following a fixed pipeline, Khora **observes, learns, and continuously adapts**.

### The Problem to Solve

*   **Static Resource Allocation**: Fixed CPU/GPU budgets that are ill-suited to the variable complexity of a scene.
*   **Manual Optimization**: Developers spend considerable time tuning settings for each target platform.
*   **Lack of Contextual Awareness**: A traditional engine doesn't know if a performance dip in the audio system is more or less impactful than one in the renderer during a cinematic.

### The Khora Solution: The Symbiotic Adaptive Architecture (SAA)

Khora flips the paradigm. Instead of a rigid orchestrator, we have a **council of intelligent agents** that negotiate and adapt.

*   **Self-Optimization**: The engine detects bottlenecks and reallocates resources to resolve them.
*   **Strategic Flexibility**: The renderer can switch from a fast technique to a high-fidelity one based on load, without developer intervention.
*   **Goal-Oriented Decision Making**: Decisions are based on high-level goals (e.g., "maintain 90fps in VR," "prioritize visual quality during cinematics").

The ultimate goal is to empower creators to focus on their artistic vision, leaving the complex task of ensuring a smooth and optimal experience on any platform to the engine itself.

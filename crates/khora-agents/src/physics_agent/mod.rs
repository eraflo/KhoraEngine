//! Acts as the **[A]gent** for the physics subsystem, fulfilling the role of an ISA.
//!
//! This module provides the high-level, tactical logic for the physics simulation.
//! It is responsible for configuring and dispatching the various `physics_lanes`
//! (e.g., broadphase, solver, integration) that perform the actual calculations.
//!
//! As an **Intelligent Subsystem Agent (ISA)**, its responsibilities will include:
//! - Reporting the simulation's performance and resource cost to the DCC.
//! - Managing multiple strategies, such as switching between a high-precision but
//!   slow physics solver and a faster, less precise one.
//! - Adapting simulation parameters (e.g., timestep frequency) based on the budget
//!   allocated by GORNA to maintain stability or performance.
